Tech Stack Used and References

The combination of the following technologies, frameworks, libraries and tools has enabled us to develop a robust and efficient website that is easy to use:  

HTML: We used HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) to create the structure of the web pages.
CSS: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) were used for styling the web pages and making them visually appealing.  

JavaScript: We utilized JavaScript to add interactivity and functionality to the website.  

AOS: used that allows you to apply different types of on scroll animations to elements
Bootstrap: We used Bootstrap, a popular front-end framework, to create a responsive and mobile-first design for the website.  
Node.js: We used Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment, for the backend development of the website. 

Express.js: Used as the web application framework for Node.js

MongoDB: used (non-relational document database) that provides support for JSON-like storage. The MongoDB database has a flexible data model that enables you to store unstructured data, and it provides full indexing support, and replication with rich and intuitive APIs.
 
APIs: used that enable two software components to communicate with each other using a set of definitions and protocols.

We used several other web platforms such as Youtube, Spotify, Audible,Amazon, Artofliving and Healthyplace to get their content.
